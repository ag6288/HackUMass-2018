## MoodSwinger

We have have seen veteran families where a person is too tired to be angry, he talks about the innocence and honor of young soldiers. Then he may suddenly cry and the heart of the family members breaks all over again. We developed this application where a family member can click a picture of the person and using the Bose soundtouch, it will play music based their emotional state without bothering them.

## Screenshots Web Application


## Getting Started

We have a web application where we click the image of the veteran and recognise the current emotion on the face of the person. After recognising it, we select a playlist based on their emotion without bothering them and help them calm down. This application has been developed keeping in mind to control the anxiety issues of the veterans and help them make a smart home.
